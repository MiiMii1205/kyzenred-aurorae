# Kyzenred
A full KDE theme based on gamer aesthetics and modern minimalism (Aurorae decorator theme)

## Dependencies
- KDE >= 5

## Installation
Just put this repository in your `~/.local/share/aurorae/themes/` directory (make a new one if it doesn't exist)

## Usage
The Kyzenred Aurorae theme should work out of the box! Just go into your KDE system manager and open up the [Windows Decoration](https://userbase.kde.org/System_Settings/Windows_Decorations) module.

## Color schemes
At its core, Kyzenred comes with its own official color scheme.
However, Kyzenred was also designed to handle any KDE color scheme you'll throw at it.

To find out how to change your KDE color scheme, [click here](https://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/kde-workspace/kcontrol/colors/index.html)!
Aurorae should handle your new color scheme like a champ! Your color scheme should get applied at your next login, so you might want to log out first...
